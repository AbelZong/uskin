USkin is a front-end framework which provides stunning web components based on CSS3 and ReactJS.

## Quick start

Three steps to go:

- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/icecreamliker/uskin/archive/master.zip). Or clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/icecreamliker/uskin.git`.
  
- You can first compile the scripts via [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) or make command (make sure Grunt is installed).

- Under the folder docs, we provide versatile samples that you can learn the baisc usage from them. And in the short future, a overview-introduction page will be shown.

## Available commands

When Grunt is installed, go ahead and compile all the files:

```
grunt release or make release
```
Run the script below to clean the generated files:
```
grunt clean or make clean
```
When test is needed:
```
grunt test or make test
```
If you want to make some slight changes, start up the following script which will compile the files when the changes are saved.
```
grunt watch or make watch
```

## Note

Details for each release are documented in the [release notes](https://github.com/icecreamliker/uskin/releases).
